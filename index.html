    answer: "âœ¨ It's very simple! Take just 1 capsule per day, at any time that's convenient for you. There's no need to take it with or without food, nor specific times.

    answer: "Many people report changes within the first 24-48 hours, especially in sleep quality and mental clarity. Within a week, the effects become more evident. For profound and lasting results, we recommend continuous use for at least 90 days, allowing complete decalcification of the pineal gland to occur."

    answer: "ðŸ’¬ From birth, we're exposed to fluoride (water, toothpaste), heavy metals, and environmental toxins that accumulate in the pineal gland. This isn't accidental, as revealed in projects like MKUltra, there's an interest in keeping the population with deactivated pineals, since people with active third eyes cannot be easily controlled or manipulated."
