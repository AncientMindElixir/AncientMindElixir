  "what is ancientmind": "AncientMind Elixir is a revolutionary supplement inspired by ancient Egyptian wisdom. It helps you awaken the pineal gland — your 'third eye'.",
  "how do i take": "Super simple: just one capsule a day, whenever you remember. Morning, night — what matters is consistency 💊",
  "how long to see results": "Some feel something in 24–48 hours. But the real magic unfolds with daily use over weeks. Trust the process 🌿",
  "side effects": "Not side effects, soul effects ✨ Dreams, clarity, energy — all part of waking up to your true self.",
  "pineal gland": "Think of it like your spiritual antenna. AncientMind detoxes, decalcifies and reactivates it 🔮",
  "why is pineal calcified": "Fluoride, stress, processed food... It all blocks your connection. But you can reverse it. We’re here for that!",
  "difference from other supplements": "This is based on real ancient Egyptian texts + modern science. Rare ingredients. Precise formula. Real results.",
  "experiences": "Users share stories of peace, clarity, vivid dreams, energy, synchronicities... it’s a true awakening journey 🧘‍♀️",
  "weird dreams": "Totally normal (and awesome). That means your mind is tuning into higher frequencies 🌌",
  "financial help": "Clear mind, sharp intuition. Better decisions, unexpected doors opening. Not magic — just alignment 💸",
  "cancel": "Hey, I get it. But before you decide, can you share why? Most people who hesitated ended up grateful they didn’t give up 🌟",
  "refund": "Let’s troubleshoot together. Been taking it daily? Avoiding fluoride? Many see change after 30–45 days. You have time, and I’m here 💚",
  "expensive": "Compared to retreats, therapies and courses... this is a fraction. And the ingredients? Rare, potent, priceless. It’s your transformation 🙌",
  "shipping": "We ship within 24h. Delivery: US 5–7 days, CA 7–10, EU 10–15. Tracking comes by email 📦",
  "medications": "It’s 100% natural 🌱 But always check with your doc if you're on meds — many users actually reduced theirs over time.",
  "guarantee": "Yep — 180 days. That’s 6 months of testing with peace of mind. We believe in this, deeply.",
  "signs of activation": "Dreams. Intuition. Flow. Synchronicities. That ‘knowing’ feeling. It’s subtle at first... then undeniable ✨",
  "family": "Absolutely. Kids, teens, adults — all safe. Especially powerful before the pineal is fully calcified 🌞",
  "stop taking": "You’ll still keep some benefits, but in our modern toxic world, regular use keeps your clarity alive."
