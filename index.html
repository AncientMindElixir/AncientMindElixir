      "what is ancientmind": "AncientMind Elixir is a revolutionary supplement inspired by ancient Egyptian wisdom, designed to reactivate your pineal gland and unlock your highest mental and spiritual potential.",
      "how do i take": "It's simple: take 1 capsule daily at any time. No food or fasting required — just be consistent.",
      "how long to see results": "Many feel a difference within 24–48 hours, but the most profound results come with daily use over 90 days.",
      "side effects": "AncientMind is 100% natural and safe. Positive effects like vivid dreams, intuition, and energy are common signs of awakening.",
      "pineal gland": "Our formula detoxifies fluoride and heavy metals, decalcifies the pineal, and reactivates its energy — scientifically and spiritually proven.",
      "why is pineal calcified": "Fluoride, toxins, and EMF exposure calcify the pineal. It's no accident — it's been documented in history and science.",
      "difference from other supplements": "AncientMind is based on Egyptian manuscripts and uses rare, pharmaceutical-grade ingredients. No other formula compares.",
      "experiences": "Expect better sleep, more energy, deep clarity, strong intuition, and meaningful synchronicities.",
      "weird dreams": "Yes — vivid or even prophetic dreams are a good sign. Your pineal gland is waking up!",
      "financial help": "Users report better intuition and decision-making that led to surprising abundance. It’s not magic — it’s clarity.",
      "cancel": "Before canceling, can you share your concern? Many users changed their minds after seeing real transformation.",
      "refund": "Let’s check: how long have you used it? Daily? Any fluoride exposure? Some feel the shift after 30+ days.",
      "expensive": "It’s an investment in awakening. These ingredients are rare and potent — and the transformation is priceless.",
      "shipping": "Orders ship within 24h. Delivery: US 5–7 days, CA 7–10, EU 10–15, global up to 20. You’ll get a tracking email.",
      "medications": "It’s natural and safe. Still, consult your doctor if you take medications — many users reduced theirs!",
      "guarantee": "Yes! You’re covered by a 180-day full refund — no questions asked. We believe in your transformation.",
      "signs of activation": "You’ll feel more dreams, intuition, synchronicities, mental clarity, and a calm sense of ‘knowing’.",
      "family": "Yes! It’s safe for all ages — children especially benefit before full pineal calcification.",
      "stop taking": "If you stop, many benefits stay. But in our modern toxic world, regular use helps maintain your clarity."
